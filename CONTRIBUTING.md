# How to contribute
- Create a pull request that adds a new language. 
- Create a folder with the name of the programing language.
- The new file must be named `<helloworld>.<extension>`
  - Please don't use characters that are invalid on Windows or Linux
  - Place the file in the right folder inside `code`. Please please **no new files on the root directory!**
- The program output can be `Hello World`, `Hello World!`, `hello world`, `Hello, world`, `hello, world`, etc... 
  - It can print to console, output text to screen or to a file, or use whatever form of output your language supports (e.g a function returning a string/array of char/array of bytes/seeded random number generator/Huffman encoded integer that represents hello world)

- Don't add existing language to the repo

## I will merge your pull request as long as it's valid. It might take about 1-24 hours
